s = #rxn-verts #species-verts source-1 target-1 source-2 target-2 ... source-n target-n
make a square vertex 0, 1, ..., s[0]-1
make a circle vertex s[0], s[0]+1, ..., s[0]+s[1]-1
draw an arrow s[i] -> s[i+1] for each pair s[i] s[i+1] starting from i = 2 until i=len(s)-1 by 2

to retrieve network now

define empty sum to be 0
find square vertex 0
	reaction source = sum of all species pointing in to 0
	reaction target = sum of all species pointing out of 0
	output as "reaction source --> reaction target" (to be used in M2)
in general: find square vertex j
	reaction source = sum of all species pointing in to j
	reaction target = sum of all species pointing out of j
	output as rxnj = "reaction source --> reaction target" [a string] (to be used in M2)
do this for all reaction verts j = 0, 1, ... , s[0]-1

then network = {rxn1, ... , rxnm}, NullSymbol => "0"


will then be able to pass to M2 as follows
	N = reactionNetwork(network)
	R = createRing(N,QQ)
	steadyStateEquations N
	conservationEquations N
